# Bento Grid — Completed solution 🎉

![Design preview for Bento grid](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome 👋

This project is the completed solution to the **Bento grid** challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to reproduce the provided design as closely as possible using plain HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).

**Main technologies:** `HTML`, `CSS` (BEM methodology used for class naming)

---

## Project overview

### Goal

Build a responsive "bento grid" layout based on the designs in the `design/` directory so that it behaves correctly on both mobile and desktop (including the placement of components when the screen width changes).

### Expected behaviour

- Layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Two components that appear in the left column on desktop are moved down on mobile (practice with CSS Grid placement)
- Visible hover and focus states for interactive elements

## How to run locally 🔧

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use Live Server in VS Code for auto-reload).

> Tip: Use the browser devtools (Toggle device toolbar) to test responsiveness.
